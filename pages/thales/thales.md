Thales Protocol offers an oracle-based automated liquidity solution, enabling the creation of various on-chain Positional Markets. These markets are limited only by the data available to the blockchain. 

The simple yet robust smart contracts at the core of Thales Market allow participation in markets for various crypto assets. However, this is not limited to straightforward up/down positions. Thales Protocol continues to innovate by developing the world's first **SportsAMM** and **ParlayAMM** solutions.

Overtime serves as a positional market for popular sporting events, operating independently of centralized entities, unlike most sports markets. Inspired by Thales contracts, and fueled by reliable data feeds from industry-leading oracle **Chainlink**, Overtime offers an unparalleled DeFi experience. Traders can enjoy sports markets without KYC, without third-party custody of funds, and without user registration. Nobody can be excluded or barred from using Overtime.

This is the first public product that combines decentralization, instant liquidity, and highly competitive oddsâ€”all in one place. Overtime is truly bringing the game to the blockchain!
